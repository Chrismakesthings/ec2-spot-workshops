# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< relref "nf_self_paced.md" >}}), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< relref "nf_aws_event" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with **[Create a Workspace]({{< relref "30_workspace.md" >}})**
