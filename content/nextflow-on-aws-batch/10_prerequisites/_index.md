# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](/nextflow-on-aws-batch/10_prerequisites/nf_self_paced.html), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](/nextflow-on-aws-batch/10_prerequisites/nf_aws_event.html)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with **[Create a Workspace]({{< relref "30_workspace.md" >}})**
