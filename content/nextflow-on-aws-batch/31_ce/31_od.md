## Create EC2 On-Demand Compute Environment

The nextflow tasks, which are supervising the orchestration of the actual workflow are not able to tolerate interruptions as they need to run for the duration of the complete workflow.
Thus, we create a small On-Demand compute environment which will run the supervision task.

### Setup Compute ENvironment

Similar to the spot environment, we choose a name (**[1]**), select the roles (**[2]** & **[3]**). As we do not need access to a local `aws-cli` we can keep the standard ECS image.

In the second section we select **On-Demand[1]** as the provisioning model and pick only `large` instances as this compute environment is running the supervising nextflow process, nothing that needs heavy computation.

We leave most of the defaults, set the **minimal and desired vCPUs to 1 [1]**.

Please paste in the AMI-ID we just created with packer **[3]**.

We keep the defaults in the third section and click **create [1]**.
